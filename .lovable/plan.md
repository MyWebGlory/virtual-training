# Landing Page: Virtual Production for Corporate Cohort Training Programs

## Purpose
A high-conversion landing page for a Meta ads campaign targeting L&D Managers, Heads of Training, and Program Directors who run large cohort-based corporate training programs (50–150+ participants). This is NOT a general website — it's a focused funnel page designed to convert ad traffic into Calendly bookings with Austin Talley.

## Design Direction
- **Dark theme** with black/near-black backgrounds, white text, and #004294 blue as the primary accent
- Bold typography, high contrast, cinematic feel — professional and commanding
- Clean, spacious layout with strong visual hierarchy
- No navigation menu (it's a landing page, not a website) — just a sticky CTA header bar
- Austin's headshot photo embedded for trust and personal connection

### 3. Problem Agitation Section — "The Hidden Cost of DIY Production"
- Three problem cards addressing the ICP's core pain points:
  - **Facilitator Overload** — "Your instructors are juggling teaching, chat, polls, breakout rooms, and troubleshooting — all at once. Teaching always suffers."
  - **Credibility at Risk** — "One technical glitch in a high-stakes cohort erodes professional trust. In corporate training, trust = future contracts."
  - **Interactivity Chaos** — "You want polls, breakout rooms, and smooth transitions. Without a dedicated producer, complexity becomes chaos."

### 4. The Shift — "What If Technology Was Never a Barrier to Learning?"
- Short, punchy reframe section
